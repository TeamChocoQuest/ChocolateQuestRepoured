Our goal with this mod is to provide a free, publicly accessable, open-source alternative to the classic Chocolate Quest mod, fully compatible with modern versions of Minecraft.
We had, at one point, intended to release this code without any restrictions. However, to prevent misleading and/or malicious use, we have elected to impart a few common-sense restrictions. If you believe that your use case is in violation of this license but do not feel that it is malicious, please reach out to the dev team (easiest method of contact is likely the publicly listed Discord server) and we may be willing to make an exception.

LICENSE:
This mod may be used, modified, and redistributed by any one, under any circumstance, so long as none of the following restrictions are violated:
1) There may be no monetary reward, including from advertisements, provided to anyone distributing this mod in either source or compiled format.
2) Any project containing some or all of the code for this mod, regardless of format, must explicitly credit the developers of this mod for their work (this means not taking credit for it either) and provide a direct link back to either the GitHub repository for this mod or an official download page thereof (for example CurseForge).
3) Don’t be a dick - the definition of this is up to the interpretation of the mod developers.

This license may be modified at any time for any reason. All users must bring their own projects into compliance within 14 days of this license being revised.

DEVELOPER AGREEMENT:
By contributing to this project, either with code or with other assets, I irrevocably grant anyone the right to use any of said code and/or assets so long as the above terms are met.
